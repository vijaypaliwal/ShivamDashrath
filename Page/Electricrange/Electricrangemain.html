            “Generally speaking, electric cooking is pretty simple. Here’s how it works...
Electric stoves have a heater that you put a pot on top of called the burner. In
almost all newer electric stoves this <span style="color:rgb(247,147,29);">burner</span> is plugged into a<span style="color:rgb(247,147,29);"> receptacle</span>, located
just beneath the stove top. The burner is controlled by a <span style="color:rgb(247,147,29);">switch</span>, which controls
the amount of heat by turning the electricity on and off for certain amounts of time
while you are cooking. Pretty simple right? Now, let’s talk about oven cooking.”

                <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
            “We can cook in the oven two ways, either by baking or broiling. For baking, we
use the heating coil at the bottom of the oven called the <span style="color:rgb(247,147,29);">bake element</span>. While
baking, we control the temperature with the <span style="color:rgb(247,147,29);">thermostat</span> by turning the element on
and off continually to get the right average temperature for cooking.”
                </p>

                  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
          “The other way we cook in the oven is by broiling, where food is placed directly
under a heater at the top of the oven called the<span style="color:rgb(247,147,29);"> broil element</span>. There is no
temperature control here, so you have to watch your food to see that we don’t burn
it up! If you do let it burn, don’t complain to your stove about it either, we’re just
doing our job. Some ranges out there have a thermostat that is designed to control
both functions, bake and broil, but most ranges just have the additional switch for
the oven called the <span style="color:rgb(247,147,29);">selector switch</span> that allows you to select either bake or broil.”
                </p>

                  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
           “Now, I don’t know if you know, but some ranges are actually built with two ovens.
That’s right, they are called double ovens. Ranges that have two ovens, will have
two sets of controls, one set for each oven. When replacing parts in a double oven,
it is important to know which oven you need the parts for since each one might be
slightly different.”

    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
      “Did you know that some ovens can clean themselves?! That’s right, self cleaning
is done by combining all of the oven components above to get the oven to heat up
to a temperature of about 800 degrees for a certain length of time to burn the oven
clean. There is also the addition of a locking system to keep the oven closed while
it is at the high temperature. Another variation in electric ranges is the ‘Convection
Oven’, which is basically a standard oven that has a combination of an additional
heater and a fan to circulate the hot air, substantially shortening the time it takes to
cook your food. My uncle is a convection oven; he is always bragging about how
fast he can cook, as if he’s a microwave or something.”

    “Today’s modern ranges are designed with convenience in mind, which is why we
are equipped with a feature that allows you to set us to start automatically and
cook your food for a pre-determined amount of time, and then shut off again. We
do this by using a clock-timer. These days, our manufacturers are combining the
functions of the thermostat, selector switch, and <span style="color:rgb(247,147,29);">clock-timer</span> into one electronic
unit. This unit is called either the electronic range control (ERC) or the electronic
oven control (EOC).”
